XDebug Helper for Google Chrome
===============================

Debugging and profiling PHP code with Xdebug is very powerful, but enabling Xdebug by 
setting a cookie or adding POST/GET variables is unnecessary hard. This extension will 
help you to enable/disable debugging and profiling with a single click.

Installation
------------
The easiest and recommended way is to go to the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc) 
and install the latest stable version from there. 

Want to get the latest development version? Download the source from GitHub and 
[load the extension into Chrome](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html) 
yourself!

Why is this on GitHub?
----------------------
We want you to help us make this extension better and we think GitHub will help a lot with 
that since you can contribute by submitting issues and pull request.

How do I contribute?
--------------------
There are basicly two options to contribute. First one; Submit an issue or feature request 
so we know what we can do to make this extension better. It's easy, just write a clear and 
positive issue and we'll look into it! (Can't promise we fix and add everything, but we will
take it into consideration.)

Second, if you know how to code Chrome Extension fix an issue or enchantment yourself by 
forking our code and submitting a pull request. Please keep pull requests small and make sure
you're working on top of the most recent code. We'll love to work with you on this project
