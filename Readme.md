XDebug Helper for Google Chrome
===============================

Debugging, profiling and tracing PHP code with [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) is very powerful, but enabling
Xdebug by setting a cookie or adding POST/GET variables is unnecessary hard. This extension will
help you to enable/disable the debugging, profiling and tracing features with a single click.

How to install this extension?
------------------------------
1. Go to the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc)
2. Click "Add to Chrome"
3. Done!
